      <br />
      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />
      Version 3, 29 June 2007<br />
      <br />
      Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. (https://fsf.org)<br />
      <br />
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
      license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br />
      <br />
      This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the
      terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU<br />
      General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed
      below.<br />
      <br />
      0. Additional Definitions.<br />
      As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
      General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to<br />
      version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br />
      <br />
      “The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
      than an Application or a Combined Work as defined<br />
      below.<br />
      <br />
      An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by
      the Library, but which is not otherwise based on<br />
      the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is
      deemed a mode of using an interface provided by<br />
      the Library.<br />
      <br />
      A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
      Application with the Library. The particular version of<br />
      the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the
      “Linked Version”.<br />
      <br />
      The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
      Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding<br />
      any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in
      isolation, are based on the Application, and not<br />
      on the Linked Version.<br />
      <br />
      The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object
      code and/or source code for the Application,<br />
      including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the
      Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the<br />
      System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br />
      <br />
      1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br />
      You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
      without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br />
      <br />
      2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br />
      If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
      facility refers to a function or data to be supplied<br />
      by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed
      when the facility is invoked), then you may<br />
      convey a copy of the modified version:<br />
      <br />
      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
      ensure that, in the event an Application does not<br />
      supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful,<br />
      or<br />
      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
      License applicable to that copy.<br />
      3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br />
      The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a
      header file that is part of the Library. You may<br />
      convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the
      incorporated material is not limited to<br />
      numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small
      macros, inline functions and templates (ten or<br />
      fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br />
      <br />
      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its<br />
      use are covered by this License.<br />
      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.<br />
      4. Combined Works.<br />
      You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
      together, effectively do not restrict modification<br />
      of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
      engineering for debugging such modifications,<br />
      if you also do each of the following:<br />
      <br />
      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its<br />
      use are covered by this License.<br />
      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.<br />
      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
      include the copyright notice for the Library<br />
      among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
      copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br />
      d) Do one of the following:<br />
      0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
      License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a<br />
      form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or
      relink the Application with a modified version<br />
      of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner
      specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for<br />
      conveying Corresponding Source.<br />
      1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
      suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at<br />
      run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
      system, and (b) will operate properly with a<br />
      modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the
      Linked Version.<br />
      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
      required to provide such information under<br />
      section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
      necessary to install and execute a modified<br />
      version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
      Application with a modified version of the Linked<br />
      Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must
      accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and<br />
      Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide
      the Installation Information in the manner<br />
      specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
      Source.)<br />
      5. Combined Libraries.<br />
      You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side
      by side in a single library together with<br />
      other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by
      this License, and convey such a combined<br />
      library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:<br />
      <br />
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
      the Library, uncombined with any other library<br />
      facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.<br />
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
      work based on the Library, and explaining where<br />
      to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br />
      6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br />
      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
      the GNU Lesser General Public License from time<br />
      to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
      version, but may differ in detail to address new<br />
      problems or concerns.<br />
      <br />
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as
      you received it specifies that a certain<br />
      numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later
      version” applies to it, you have the option of<br />
      following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of
      any later version published by the Free<br />
      Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a
      version number of the GNU Lesser General<br />
      Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General
      Public License ever published by the Free Software<br />
      Foundation.<br />
      <br />
      If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
      whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General<br />
      Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of
      any version is permanent authorization for<br />
      you to choose that version for the Library.<br />
